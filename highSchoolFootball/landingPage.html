          <div class="col">
            <p>Red Wolves football has been around since the inception of the league in 1929 by founder Joseph J. Tomlin as a four-team conference in Northeast Philadelphia.Since then, participation has steadily increased to today's record numbers. Over 1,500 youths participated in high school-sanctioned football programs in 2000, and those numbers are continuing to grow.</p>

            <h3>SAFETY FIRST</h3>
          <div class="col">
            <p>Leagues have options with how to structure their program. While leagues can continue the current structure where a player is placed in a division based on his or her age and weight, they may also instead choose to register players based on age only. Currently, an estimated 75-80% of youth football nationally follows an age-only structure.The Red Wolves place value on safety measures that make a difference. Thatâ€™s why we have also done things in football like reduce contact to 25% of practice time, eliminate kickoffs for our youngest divisions and require that any player who suffers a suspected head injury receive medical clearance from a concussion specialist before returning to play.</p>

                <h3>TRACEABLE STATS</h3>
                <p>The Red Wolves exists to use football, cheerleading, dance and a respect for education to develop strong, smart, responsible, healthy young men and women. We give them experiences that build their appreciation for and understanding of leadership, teamwork, and discipline. While individual statistics may be more common, particularly among older football players, Pop Warner only recognizes the athletic accomplishments of the team, not the individual.</p>
